				<div class="description">
					<p>In our nation's thousands of years of history, there has never been a work as beloved by the people as The Tale of Kieu. Although national political institutions change over time, people's passion for The Tale of Kieu has not changed. Why? Dao Nguyen Pho, in the preface to the book Doan Truong Tan Thanh (also known as The Tale of Kieu) published in 1902, replied: "The words are beautiful but flowery, the tone is resonant but round, the materials chosen are very broad, the events It is told very well, gleaning the romantic love songs of the ancients, and also contributing to the country's proverbs, salty, trivial, rustic and elegant... making people laugh, making people cry, making people cry. Some people are happy, it makes others sad, it makes people turn it over and over again a thousand times, the more they recite it, the more they never get bored. It's truly a wonderful Southern song, such a popular love tune."</p>
